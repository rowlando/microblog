A quick note on [Sam Newman's Rip It Up](https://samnewman.io/talks/rip-it-up/) talk: 

- Loved the bit towards the end around local optimisation problems
- risk is you could end up with 3 or 4 databases used across the department
  - comes with cost of licensing and support
  - also experience is spread too thin and makes it difficult for people to switch teams
    - there's a tradeoff between local cost and global optimisations
    - need cross cutting group to spot local trends or niche tech. Can also spot potential duplication and opportunities to standardise, could be a simple as tech leads meeting regularly
    - communities of practice and governance are two other ways
    - don't use COP for tech governance unless you want a bottom up approach
        - suits smaller organisations
