Someone asked me recently if I read fiction. They seemed troubled that I'm always recommending 
work-related books. The answer is yes, I read fiction, mainly in the dead of night, as tool to 
help me back to sleep. Here's some of the books I've read recently:

- Quicksand by Steve Tolz
- Hot Milk by Deborah Levy
- Normal People by Sally Rooney
- Love In The Time Of Cholera by Gabriel García Márquez
- The Sense Of An Ending by Julian Barnes

I'm currently reading Black Water Lillies by Michel Bussi.

And these books are on my physical or audio bookshelf waiting to be read:

- The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles
- Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut, read by John Malkovich
- Thérèse Raquin by Emile Zola, read by Kate Winslet
