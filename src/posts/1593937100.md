Small, post-lockdown adventures:

- The boy and I went out for ate breakfast at a [local cafe](https://twitter.com/browngreencafe/status/1279365415844614144?s=20). I had Aussie Eggs, he had a kids fry up.
- Met a friend in a park. She's bringing our annual [local festival online](https://twitter.com/CPFestivalUK/status/1277904952313118721?s=20)!
- Met with up with my friend Mark at a pub last night!

I made some music yesterday on my Akai MPC X. For the drums, I took inspiration from Massive Attack's Teardrop.

Over the past couple of months I've markedly improved note taking and organising life using digital tools. The two tools I most use are Roam Research and Notion. I'm going to try out [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/) for bookmarking.
