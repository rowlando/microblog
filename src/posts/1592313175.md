I'm enjoying my week off work.

The boy and I went to [Happy Valley](https://www.friendsoffarthingdowns.co.uk/gpage22.html) and flew a kite in one of the meadows surrounded by woodland. In the evening had a few beers in my road's communal garden with 10 of my closest neighbours :-) And one of my neighbour's finished fixing my bike! Neighbours are great.

I cycled to [Selsdon Wood](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/features/selsdon-wood) and back, and discovered the [Vanguard Way](http://www.vanguardway.org.uk/), which is now on my walk list. And went for a walk with a friend in the evening.

I took delivery of an Akai MPC X and made some tunes. Very steep learning curve. There's so many great people to learn from on YouTube, on just any topic. [YouTube is revolutionary](https://medium.com/@samo.burja/the-youtube-revolution-in-knowledge-transfer-cb701f82096a) when it comes to learning from people's tacit knowledge. Originally found this article from this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1264757794298789890) where one tweet refers to YouTube as "the internet of know-how".

> Massively available video recordings of practitioners in action change this entirely. Through these videos, learners can now partially replicate the master-apprentice relationship, opening up skill domains and economic niches that were previously cordoned off by personal access.

Also, found homes for things I don't need anymore. Facebook Marketplace and local buy/sell groups is the only time I venture on to Facebook. I had a quick look over the fence at the social feed. Still awful.

And the boy went back to school and is enjoying it! On the walk back home, after school, I noticed people drinking pints outside one of the locals.
