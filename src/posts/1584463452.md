Simple tools that work in crisis.

1. Recognise what you don't have control of
2. Write a journal to give you clarity over competing anxious feelings, thoughts and what is known/unknown in reality
3. Get your heartrate up for at least 20 minutes per day, preferably outside
4. Practice 7/11 breathing technique for 5 minutes
5. Do things that comfort and soothe you

Our body is a system. Do these things daily to keep it in balance.
