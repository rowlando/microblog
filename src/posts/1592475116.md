These are the typical constraints of software in expensive data centres:

1. Getting an environment. You're joking!
2. Code deployment. Come back next week once you've spoken to a a release manager.
3. Tests. Where has all the test data gone? I can't test, need a refresh from prod.
4. Approval. Sorry, need to ask team x,y & z for approval, as they'll probably need to make a change too.


What can you do?

1. Provision environments using code, a.k.a. infrastructure as code.
2. Deploy your code using code, a.k.a. build & deployment pipelines. 
3. Test your code using code. Store app code, test code and test data together. And version it.
4. Decouple your software into smaller chunks, aiming for independent deployments.

What can you do with the public cloud?

1. Cheap, fast, secure provision of environments and services
2. Take advantage of excellent Software-as-a-Service products to make continuous integration and continuous delivery easier
3. Automate functional and non-functional tests against prod and non-prod environments.
4. Observe your production systems easily.
5. Be the motivator for breaking your apps apart to take advantage of cloud native features. Think 12 factor principles.

## Public cloud for legacy ERP systems
What about legacy ERP systems? Will a lift and shift of a system like Oracle E-Business Suite unlock any of the benefits of easier provisioning, deployment, testing or decomposability?

I'm not so sure.

The only arguments I hear for these types of migrations is an economic one. Lots of money will be saved by moving from an expensive data centre to cheaper hosting on public cloud. Factoring in the migration costs, I'm left pondering whether the numbers stack up.
